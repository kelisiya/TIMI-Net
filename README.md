## Tripartite Information Mining and Integration for Image Matting (Timi-Net)

*Yuhao Liu\*, Jiake Xie\*, Xiao Shi, Yu Qiao, Yujie Huang, Yong Tang, Xin Yang*
This is the official PyTorch implementation of our paper [**Tripartite Information Mining and Integration for Image Matting**](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Liu_Tripartite_Information_Mining_and_Integration_for_Image_Matting_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf) that has been accepted to 2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2021).

## Get Started

## Requirements ##

The repository is trained and tested on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS, based on the main following settings.

- [x] python 3.6+  
- [x] Pytorch 1.1.0+
- [x] cuda 11.0+

## Usage ##

#### Testing

To quickly test sample images with our model (trained on Adobe dataset), you can just run through

```shell
cd Timi-Net
python test.py 
```

By default, the code takes the data in the "./inputs/" folder, loads the "TIMI-Net.pth" model and saves results in the "./outputs/" folder.  Please read the code to see other parameter settings.
